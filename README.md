 Classic Snake Game in C++

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C++. It's a console application where the player controls a snake, aiming to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail.

 Features

- Control the snake using W, A, S, D keys.
- The snake grows in length every time it consumes food.
- The game's difficulty increases gradually as the snake becomes longer.
- The game ends if the snake hits a wall or its own body.

Getting Started

To play the game, clone the repository and compile the code using a C++ compiler that supports C++17 or higher standards.

 Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler compatible with C++17.
- A Windows environment to run the executable, as it uses system-specific features.

Compilation and Execution

1. Clone the repository:
https://github.com/Sutener2/Snake2

2. 2. Navigate to the cloned directory and compile the code:
g++ -o SnakeGame SnakeGame.cpp
3. Run the compiled executable:
./SnakeGame
## Controls

- `W` - Move up
- `S` - Move down
- `A` - Move left
- `D` - Move right

Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's body. Try to eat as much food as possible to increase your score!
